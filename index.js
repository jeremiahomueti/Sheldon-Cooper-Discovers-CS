/* 
For a long time in JavaScript, if you wanted to declare a 
variable, you had to use the 'Var' keyword - but starting
with ES6 in in 2015, you can now declare variables with 
Let and Const



Let does not allow you declare the same variable twice.

For example: 

let highIQ = Young Sheldon;
let highEQ = Young Missy;

...which is good, because you don't want to be able to declare 
the same variable twice, unless you intend to replace the value
in the variable -- well in that case, it's best for such a process
to have a different syntax from that of declaring a variable, 
which Let does so beautifully. You see? Now my friend, take a 
glass of water, sit down and let's stair into the far ends of 
this beautiful ocean, as we as we sail on this yatch, and enjoy the relaxing breeze of the 
dark night, the harmony of the band players, breathe!! frankSinatra
will join us in here shortly, and we shall chat even further about
the beauties of Let and Const.
